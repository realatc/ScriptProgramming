#----------------------------------------------------------[Variables]-------------------------------------------------------
### You can store all types of values in PowerShell variables. 
### A variable is a unit of memory in which values are stored. 
### 1. Create a two int variables $i and $x and assign the value to 122 and 633 respectively.
## YOUR CODE HERE



### 2. Now, add $i and $x together and store the value in another variable $y. 
### Then output(print) the value of $y to the console.
## YOUR CODE HERE


### 3. Divide $y by $i and round the answer to the two closest decimal places and 
### store the value in variable $z. Then print value of $z to the console. 
### HINT: Do some research on how to round values in PowerShell online. Lots of examples are available ;)
## YOUR CODE HERE



### 4. In PowerShell strings and number variables can added together. 
### Create a variable $str and set it to "The value of z is: " and 
### add $str and $z together. Then output $str to the console.
## YOUR CODE HERE




#----------------------------------------------------------[Arrays]-------------------------------------------------------
### Arrays are powerfull datatype that can store a collection of items.
### 1. Create an array variable named $arr and set it to 
### the following collection of integers (10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100)
## YOUR CODE HERE



### 2. Create a new variable called $itemSum and store the sum of the 2nd and last item in $arr. 
### Print the resule to the console. (10,->20<-,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,->100<-)
## YOUR CODE HERE



#----------------------------------------------------------[CMDLET]-------------------------------------------------------
### This section examines the use of CMDLETs to find information. 
### It begins with a large set of data returned back to us. Later we will continue
### to filter out unneccessary data until the desired set of data is returned.
### 1. Create a variable called $files1 and assign it the output all files including 
### inside of subfolders in C:\Windows\System32\driverStore using the cmdlet Get-ChildItem
## HINT: You will need to use two additional parameters to recusively retrieve files in sub-directories
## HINT: 1644 items will be returned. Use count attribute to verify size (Example: $files1.count)
## YOUR CODE HERE



### 2. Create a variable called $files2 and assign it the output all ".sys" files 
### in C:\Windows\System32\driverStore using the cmdlet: Get-ChildItem
## HINT: 329 files returned
## YOUR CODE HERE



### 3. Create a variable called $files3 and assign it the output all ".sys" files 
### larger than 500 KB (Length > 500KB) in 
### C:\Windows\System32\driverStore using the cmdlet: Get-ChildItem
## HINT: Length property is in Bytes 500KB = 512000 Bytes
## HINT: 51 files returned. 
## YOUR CODE HERE



### 4.  Create a variable called $files4 and assign it the output all ".sys" files 
### that start with the letter s and larger than 500 KB (Length > 500KB) in 
### C:\Windows\System32\driverStore using the cmdlet: Get-ChildItem
## HINT: 2 files returned
## YOUR CODE HERE



### 5. Now that the two files we were looking for are found and stored in $files4, 
## let's export them out to CSV file named findings.csv
## HINT: 1 CSV file should output to the current directory. 
## YOUR CODE HERE



### 6. Over 1000 CMDLETS are available in PowerShell, research and find 
### a CMDLET to test displays diagnostic information for a network connection. 
### For this exercise, setup a network connection test to ung.edu using port 443
### and store the variable name $connection. 
### Lastly, print $connection to the console. Did it succeed?
